# Loading data

In the previous section, we've worked on getting started with a new ML.NET
application. In this section, we'll start writing code to load labeled Github
issues that we're going to use to train our machine learning model.

We'll cover the following topics in this section:

* Preparing the dataset
* Creating the input and output for the model
* Loading the dataset

Let's start preparing the data for the application.

## Preparing the dataset

We're going to be using Github issue data to build a model that predicts the
correct label for issues. Using machine learning to label issues saves
developers time categorizing issues in their open-source projects.

As with many sample applications, we're not going to use the Github API in any
way. Instead, we'll use a dataset that we've prepared earlier for the project.

Later on we'll test our classifier on a simple website where you can copy/paste
issue information for classification.

The dataset itself is a Tab-separated file that contains the following fields:

* ID	
* Area	
* Title	
* Description

Our model is going to predict the value of the `Area` field. To predict the
value for this field, we'll use the `Title` and `Description` fields.

The `Area` field is the label column, while the `Title` and `Description`
columns are the features used by our model to make a prediction.

[Download the dataset](https://github.com/wmeints/mlnet-tutorial/raw/master/data/corefx-issues-train.tsv)

After downloading the dataset, place it in the `data` folder within the solution
folder.

Next, we'll create a few classes that model the input and output of the model.

## Creating the input and output for the model

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/l6G8PE3C7VI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6G8PE3C7VI "Create model input/output")

To train the model and make a prediction later, we need to map the input and
output data to a class.

We're going to create two classes:

* GithubIssue - The representation of a Github issue
* GithubIssuePrediction - The representation of the output of the model

Let's start with the `GithubIssue` class. 
Open up Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio and add a new file `GithubIssue.cs`
to the `Model` project. Copy-paste the code below into this file:

``` csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Data;

namespace GithubIssueClassifier.Model
{
    public class GithubIssue
    {
        [LoadColumn(0)]
        public string ID { get; set; }

        [LoadColumn(1)]
        public string Area { get; set; }

        [LoadColumn(2)]
        public string Title { get; set; }

        [LoadColumn(3)]
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This class contains the following properties:

* ID - The ID of the issue
* Area - The product area that should fix the issue
* Title - The title of the issue
* Description - The description of the issue

Notice, how this maps precisely to the dataset that we're using. 

After creating the GithubIssue class, we need to create a
`GithubIssuePrediction` class. Create a new file in the Model project called
`GithubIssuePrediction.cs` and paste the following code into the new file.

``` csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Data;

namespace GithubIssueClassifier.Model
{
    public class GithubIssuePrediction
    {
        [ColumnName("PredictedLabel")]
        public string Area { get; set; }

        public float[] Score { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This class contains the following properties:

* Area - The predicted area for the issue
* Score - The score for each different label that the model can predict

Now that we have the input and output for the model let's load up the dataset
and see what it looks like in our training program.

## Loading the dataset

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/61gGJMefCsY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gGJMefCsY "Load data")

ML.NET uses data views to model data coming from a data source. You can choose
to either load data from text files or from a data source that supports
`IEnumerable<T>`.

In this section, we're going modify the `Trainer` project to load data from a
text file and generate a preview for the data in the terminal.

ML.NET doesn't supply you with a data source for SQL Server or another database.
However, it makes it easy to load data from these data sources thanks to the
support for `IEnumerable<T>`. We're not going to zoom in on this during the
tutorial, but know that it is possible to use a database.

Start by opening the `Program.cs` file in the `Trainer` project and add the 
following code to the `Main` method of the application:

``` csharp
var mlContext = new MLContext();
var dataView = mlContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile<GithubIssue>(
    "../Data/corefx-issues-train.tsv",
    separatorChar: '\t',
    hasHeader: true,
    allowSparse: false);
```

The code does the following:

1. Create a new machine learning context
2. Load the dataset from the text file

We've specified that the trainer should use a tab-character as separator and
skip the header row in the input file. Also, we've made sure that it doesn't
load sparse data. We don't want that in our application at this point.

You can run the application if you wish.
When running the application, you should see no output or errors.

Once the data is loaded, we can preprocess it for training a model.

## Preprocessing the data

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/zky6yjnG3AQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zky6yjnG3AQ "Create pipeline")

The final step in this section of the tutorial is to preprocess the data
so that we can train a model with it.

Open up the `Program.cs` file and add the following code to the end of the
`Main` method.

``` csharp
var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey("Label", "Area")
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText("TitleFeaturized", "Title"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText("DescriptionFeaturized", "Description"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "TitleFeaturized", "DescriptionFeaturized"))
    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext);
```

This code does the following: 

1. Convert the area property to a key so that we can use it as the predicted
   output.
2. Convert the title into a featurized column, splitting the text in separate
   words.
3. Convert the description into a featurized column, splitting the text into
   separate words.
4. Convert the TitleFeatured + DescriptionFeaturized columns into a single
   column
5. Adding a caching checkpoint so training is a little faster.

Caching can reduce the time it takes to train the model. However, it doesn't
work for more massive datasets. So make sure that you're using this with
caution. Leave it off by default.

The pipeline is an essential piece of machinery. We're going to use it to train
the model later on and we'll also use it during prediction.

## Summary
In this section, we've set up the boilerplate code to work with the model and
the dataset. We've also loaded the dataset and made a machine learning pipeline
for use during the next section.

In the next section, we'll cover how to train a machine learning model.
